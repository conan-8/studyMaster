-- 005_dev_student_events.sql — dev-only anon read/write on student_events so the
-- local simulator + zen mode can record answers and the looseleaf dashboard can
-- read them back. Fixed student_id 'dev' keeps the blast radius tiny.
--
-- PRE-LAUNCH TODO: drop this policy; replace with owner-scoped auth policies
-- once real accounts exist (mirrors the bluebook_questions dev posture).
